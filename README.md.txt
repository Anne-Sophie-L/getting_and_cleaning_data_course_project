To be able to run the analysis you have to run the run_analysis.R script in R. 
Before running it, just be careful that the work directory is the one that contains the script.

This script will process the data as asked on coursera and produce a file named
"tidy_data_answer_Q5.txt" that contains a tidy data set which is (hopefully) 
the answer to the question 5 of the project.


for a description of the differents variables have a look at the code book.
